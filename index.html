<td>Searching for Light Dark Matter with the future TESSERACT experiment at LSM</td>
<td>The future TESSERACT (Transition Edge Sensor with Sub-Ev Resolution and Cryogenic Targets) experiment aims at searching for light Dark Matter candidates in the sub-GeV range down to the keV-scale from the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane. To do so, it is being designed to be highly sensitive to both nuclear recoil DM (NRDM) and electron recoil DM (ERDM) interactions. Multiple target materials will be used, sharing identical readout using Transition Edge Sensors operated at 10 mK. In addition to maximizing sensitivity to a variety of DM interactions, this provides an independent handle on instrumental backgrounds. Three detector technologies will be implemented: HeRALD which will use superfluid helium-4 as a target material, SPICE which will use polar and scintillating crystals, and Ge/Si semiconductors that will be developed by the French TESSERACT collaborators. In this talk, I will give an overview of the design status of the future TESSERACT experiment, discuss its different detector technologies with an emphasis on the Ge/Si one currently being developed in the context of the Ricochet neutrino experiment, and will present the science prospect of the experiment.

<td>Binary Neutron Stars: from macroscopic collisions to microphysics</td>
<td>I will argue that if black holes represent one the most fascinating implications of Einstein's theory of gravity, neutron stars in binary system are its richest laboratory, where gravity blends with astrophysics and particle physics. I will discuss the rapid recent progress made in modelling these systems and show how the gravitational signal can provide tight constraints on the equation of state and sound speed for matter at nuclear densities, as well as on one of the most important consequences of general relativity for compact stars: the existence of a maximum mass. Finally, I will discuss how the merger may lead to a phase transition from hadronic to quark matter. Such a process would lead to a signature in the post-merger gravitational-wave signal and open an observational window on the production of quark matter in the present Universe.</td>

<td>Opportunities and challenges in SBI for future gravitational wave detectors</td>
<td>Simulation based inference (SBI) is becoming increasingly important in the analysis of data from the current generation of ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Plans are well advanced for future generations of detector, on the ground, and also in space. These future detectors will pose many more challenges that will test the boundaries of what is possible with both classical and machine-learning based methods. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the current state of the art in SBI for gravitational wave inference, focussing in particular on the DINGO analysis package. I will then describe the many new challenges that future detectors will pose, focussing on the case of LISA, the planned space-based gravitational wave detector due for launch in the mid 2030s. I will describe the classical approaches that are being developed to tackle the LISA data analysis problem and highlight areas where SBI methods could play a critical role in addressing the outstanding problems.</td>
